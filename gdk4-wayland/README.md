__Rust__ bindings and wrappers for __GDK 4's Wayland backend__.

## Documentation
- [Stable] TODO
- [Developement](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/gdk4-wayland/)
- [The C documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/gdk4/stable/gdk4-Wayland-Interaction.html)


## Building

__gdk4-wayland__ expects the developement files of various libraries to be installed on your machine.You can follow [the installation instructions](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/)

## Using

We recommend using [crates from crates.io](https://crates.io/keywords/gtk-rs),
as [demonstrated here](https://gtk-rs.org/#using).

If you want to track the bleeding edge, use the git dependency instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
gdk-wayland = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs.git", package = "gdk4-wayland" }
```

Avoid mixing versioned and git crates like this:

```toml
# This will not compile
[dependencies]
gdk-x11 = {version = "0.1", package = "gdk-x114"}
gdk-wayland = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs.git", package = "gdk4-wayland" }
```
